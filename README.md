# AI Engineer Journey

Building real AI systems daily.
No tutorials. No fluff. Just shipping.

## Progress Log

### ✅ Day 1

* Installed Ollama
* Ran local Mistral model
* Built basic CLI chatbot
* Learned Git + secret handling

### ✅ Day 2

* Built CLI text summarizer
* Introduced system prompts
* Enforced structured bullet output
* Learned prompt control

### ✅ Day 3

* Built conversational agent
* Implemented in-memory message history
* Learned core agent loop (model + state + loop)

### ✅ Day 4

* Added persistent disk memory (`memory.json`)
* Implemented load/save logic
* Built restartable AI agent
* Learned data integrity basics

### ✅ Day 5

* Added permanent persona layer
* Implemented working memory vs long-term memory
* Added history pruning (`MAX_HISTORY`)
* Built production-style agent architecture

### ⏳ Day 6 (Next)

* Tool usage (agent can call functions)
* First “action-capable” agent
* Begin moving from assistant → operator

## Current Architecture

* Model: Mistral (local via Ollama)
* Interface: CLI
* Persona: System prompt layer
* Working Memory: Last N messages
* Long-Term Memory: JSON disk persistence
* Agent Type: Loop-based conversational agent

## Core Concepts Implemented

* Local LLM runtime
* Prompt engineering
* Agent loop
* In-memory state
* Persistent memory
* Persona control
* Context pruning
